            <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
            <h3> Welcome! About Me</h3>
                        <p> My name is Crystal, I am a Graphic Design Major @CSN. I am a mother. I enjoy the little moments with my son. Life is busy and seeing him smile is the biggest blessing. When I can take a minute to myself, I love to watch the sun rise. I have a few favorite spots locally in Henderson I like to take photos of the desert sky. I find something magical about the first ray of light as it contrast the dark side of the morning. I also enjoy exploring the trails at Mount Charleston. </p>

                        <p> This semester I decided to join the CSN Creative Writing Club. I am the secretary and Instagram Manager. I have been posting Daily Writing Prompts to inspire CSN students to tap into their creative side. The club publishes a student collection called Neon Dreams, filled with fiction, nonfiction, poetry, song lyrics, comic strips, short stories, one-act  plays artwork, and photography. I hope that my efforts will help bridge networking gaps between the student body between all creative departments, while building a solid foundation for a successful future. Together we can create a healthy community and can bring forth positive change in the world. </p>
 
                        <p> Goals for my future. My brand is Cosmic Soulja. My current project is making candles. I am learning how to make guided meditations. I would like to share them on YouTube, with the intention they helped me, maybe they can help others. I will eventually have a link to an online store to promote my arts, crafts and skills. I plan to expand, having a new age apothecary with a studio area that I can host yoga, creative workshops, woman's retreats, or even private events like bridal/ baby showers.
